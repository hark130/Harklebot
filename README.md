# Learning Network Programming - Webcomic scrapers written in Python 3 #

## Background: ##
  In an effort to better understand network programming, I sought out to learn while also doing something meaningful (to me).  This eventually led me to writing web scrapers for webcomics I like and webcomics I'm interested in.  So far, the journey of discovery has been enlightening.
  
## Disclaimer: ##
  I realize that much of my work has already been included in other modules (e.g., Beautiful Soup) but, as I said in the Background, this is a journey of discovery.  I also happen to be relatively new to Python so 'Pythonic' and 'idiomatic' feedback is welcome and encouraged.

## Scrapers: ##
    * Fully Functional:
        * XKCD
        * Business Cat
        * Penny Arcade
        * Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal
    * In Progress:
        * Ctrl-Alt-Del
        * Order of the Stick (see: Giant in the Playground)
        * Player vs Player (PvP) 
        * Awkward Zombie
    * On Deck:
        * Cyanide and Happiness
        * Accursed Dragon
    
## Modules: ##
      * Scraper_Functions - Functions to aid in finding appropriate image dates and names to aid in filename creation
      * Robot_Reader - Functions to read and parse a site's robots.txt file
  
## Project's Goals: ##
    1. Learn networking programming utilizing relatively low-level modules in Python 3
    2. Better learn and understand Python 3 and the Pythonic style
    3. ~~Fully~~ _Mostly_ automate web scraping functions to download webcomic images from their websites
    4. ~~Fully~~ _Mostly_ play nice when it comes to a site's 'suggestions' as documented in their robots.txt file

## Project's Future: ##
    1. Transition functions into class definition
